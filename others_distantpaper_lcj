# Project: LCJ Distance Paper

# Method: binomial logistic regression
# H0 for model1: distance does not influence the participation rate
# H0 for model2: distance and floor do not influence the participation rate

# variables:
# metre: distance to the wet waste station
# n.hh: total households in each building
# hh: number of household participating
# floor: floor level

# import data
d <- read.csv("E:\\Dropbox\\5- PROJECT WX\\201807 LCJ_Dispaper\\180709dataori.csv")

# model 1
# model 1: binominal logit model "metre"~ pr

# model2: binominal logit model "metre" + "floor" ~ pr
m2 <- glm(formula = cbind(hh, n.hh - hh) ~ metre + factor(floor), data = d, family = binomial(logit))

# Floor is not related with recycling behaviour in the m2. 
# We test whether m1 is better than m2.

anova(m1, m2, test = "Chisq")

# Adding floor in the model does not improve the model fit.
